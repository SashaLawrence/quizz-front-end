## Wireframes:
To begin with I did research into other quiz apps and found a design on dribble which I thought would be great to turn into a working app.

Here is the colour palette I created for the app using the design from dribble and photoshop to eye drop the hex colours and put them in a pallette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/.)

## Images

the logo in the congratulations page is from two images from [undraw] (https://undraw.co/)that I combined and tweaked together in Illustator.
